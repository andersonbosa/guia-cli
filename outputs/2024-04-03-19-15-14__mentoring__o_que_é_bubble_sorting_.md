**Bubble Sort**

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

**How it works:**

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements.
3. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
4. Move to the next two elements.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the end of the list.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until the list is sorted.

**Example:**

Let's sort the list [5, 3, 1, 2, 4] using bubble sort:

* **Pass 1:**
    * Compare 5 and 3: Swap (5, 3) -> [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
    * Compare 5 and 1: Swap (5, 1) -> [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
    * Compare 5 and 2: Swap (5, 2) -> [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]
    * Compare 5 and 4: No swap
* **Pass 2:**
    * Compare 3 and 1: Swap (3, 1) -> [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
    * Compare 3 and 2: Swap (3, 2) -> [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]
    * Compare 3 and 5: No swap
    * Compare 3 and 4: No swap
* **Pass 3:**
    * Compare 1 and 2: No swap
    * Compare 1 and 3: No swap
    * Compare 1 and 5: No swap
    * Compare 1 and 4: No swap

The list is now sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

**Benefits:**

* Simple to implement.
* Stable (elements with equal values maintain their relative order).

**Disadvantages:**

* Inefficient for large lists (time complexity: O(n^2)).
* Not suitable for real-time applications.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

* Use bubble sort only for small lists or educational purposes.
* Consider using more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or merge sort for larger lists.
