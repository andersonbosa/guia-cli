**Bubble Sort**

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues to iterate through the list until no more swaps are needed.

**How it Works:**

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the current element with the next element.
3. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
4. Move to the next element and repeat steps 2-3.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no more swaps are made.

**Example:**

Consider the following unsorted list: [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]

**Iteration 1:**
- Compare 5 and 3: Swap (5, 3)
- Compare 3 and 1: Swap (3, 1)
- Compare 1 and 2: Swap (1, 2)
- Compare 2 and 4: No swap

**Iteration 2:**
- Compare 5 and 3: No swap
- Compare 3 and 1: No swap
- Compare 1 and 2: No swap
- Compare 2 and 4: Swap (2, 4)

**Iteration 3:**
- Compare 5 and 3: No swap
- Compare 3 and 1: No swap
- Compare 1 and 2: No swap
- Compare 2 and 4: No swap

**Result:** The list is now sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Benefits:**

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Stable, meaning elements with equal values maintain their relative order.

**Disadvantages:**

- Inefficient for large datasets (time complexity of O(n^2)).
- Not suitable for real-time applications.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

- Use bubble sort for small datasets or when simplicity is more important than efficiency.
- Consider using more efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, merge sort) for larger datasets.
